# TorLinker
TorLinker will mirror your torrent seeding folder to another folder using hard links. 

History is saved in a database (TorLinker.db by default) so files/folders removed from the links folder will not be recopied. 

This means that you can continue to seed your original torrents while you also have a copy that you can move, rename and delete, without using any additional space on your disk.

Edit the py file before using and add the path to your seed folder and link folder under options.
